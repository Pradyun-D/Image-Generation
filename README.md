# Underwater Image Generation & Enhancement

## Project Overview
This project explores image generation and enhancement techniques such as VAEs, GANs, and related models, applied to underwater imagery. The objective is to evaluate how different generative models can enhance and reconstruct underwater images, which are often degraded due to lighting and scattering effects.

## Methods

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Implemented and trained a VAE for underwater image enhancement.
- Generated enhanced images using the trained VAE.
    
### GANs for Underwater Image Enhancement
- Implemented a GAN using the generator and discriminator.
- Trained the GAN on underwater images.
- Generated enhanced images using the trained GAN.

## Results
  ### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - MSE: 0.0379
  - PSNR: 14.52 dB
  - SSIM: 0.2932

  ### Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN)
  - MSE: 0.0134
  - PSNR: 19.62 dB
  - SSIM: 0.7283
